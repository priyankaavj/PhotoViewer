HTML, CSS, JS for a photo grid and a lightbox photo viewer.
Works on the latest version of Chrome, Firefox, IE and Safari.

No external JS libraries.

Some optimizations for the future
1. Load only a few images at launch, and add more on scroll
2. Update existing carousel elements instead of purging and re-creating
